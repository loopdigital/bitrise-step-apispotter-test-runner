        Abort the current build if we detect that your API's having some troubles.

        With this option set to 'no', build will not be aborted if the test result is false, it will only abort when a fatal error occur. (Like internal errors or exceptions, if we can't run the test group.) 
        If you set this option to 'yes', build will be aborted when the retrieved test result is false too.
